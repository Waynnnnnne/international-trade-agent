The user provided a detailed text about the export process, including steps like customs declaration, obtaining shipping documents, payment collection, and verification. The entity types to extract are organization, person, geo, and event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each part of the text to identify entities that fit these types. Let's start with organizations. The text mentions \"合作报关行\" which translates to a customs brokerage firm. That's an organization. Then there's the shipping company, which is also an organization. The \"海关\" is Customs, a government organization. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is mentioned too, another organization.\n\nFor persons, the text refers to a \"专业报关员\" or professional customs declarant, which is a person. \n\nEvents include customs declaration and clearance, obtaining shipping documents, payment collection, and verification. These are all events in the export process. \n\nNow, relationships. The customs brokerage firm works with Customs, so there's a relationship there. The professional declarant works for the brokerage firm. The shipping company interacts with Customs for inspections. SAFE oversees the verification event. The events are connected in sequence: declaration leads to obtaining documents, payment collection leads to verification. \n\nI need to make sure not to include any entities outside the given types. The previous response missed some entities like the specific documents (e.g., export license, commercial invoice), but those are not organizations, persons, geos, or events. So they shouldn't be included. \n\nWait, the user mentioned geo as an entity type, but the text doesn't reference any geographical locations. So no geo entities here. \n\nLet me check again. The process involves steps handled by organizations and persons, and events. No locations are specified, so geo isn't applicable here. \n\nI think that's all.
