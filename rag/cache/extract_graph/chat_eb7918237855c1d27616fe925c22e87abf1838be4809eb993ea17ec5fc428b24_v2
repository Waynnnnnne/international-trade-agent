The user wants me to extract entities and their relationships from a given text. The entity types are organization, person, geo, and event. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.\n\nThe text is in Chinese and seems to be about foreign trade processes. The first part talks about customer development, mentioning different methods like SNS sites (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook), video marketing (YouTube), blog marketing (Blogger, WordPress), and Google search. These are all platforms or tools, so maybe some of them qualify as organizations. For example, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Blogger, WordPress, and Google are all companies or platforms, so they should be tagged as organizations.\n\nNext, there's a mention of \"大野\" (Dà Yě), who seems to be a person giving advice. So \"大野\" is a person entity. The text also refers to \"客户\" (customers) and \"公司\" (companies), but those are generic terms, not specific entities. \n\nLooking at the sections on pricing and contracts, there are terms like FOB, CIF, CFR, EXW, TT, LC, which are trade terms, but they don't fit the entity types listed. Similarly, terms like PO (Purchase Order) and PI (Proforma Invoice) are part of the process but not entities. \n\nGeographical entities (geo) are not explicitly mentioned in the text. There's no mention of countries, cities, or regions. Events are also not present here; the text is more about processes and methods rather than specific occurrences.\n\nNow, for relationships. The main person here is 大野 (Dà Yě), who shares knowledge about using various platforms. So he would be related to each of the organizations mentioned (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) as he uses or recommends them. The strength of these relationships might be moderate since he's advising on their use but not necessarily directly affiliated with them.\n\nWait, but the example outputs have relationship strengths as numbers. How do I determine that? The examples use higher numbers for direct affiliations, like being a chair (strength 9) or ownership (5). Here, 大野 is recommending these platforms, so maybe a lower score, like 3 or 4, since it's a recommendation but not a formal role.\n\nAlso, the text mentions that using these platforms can help in customer development and even starting a business. So each platform is related to the process of customer development, which might be an event? But event isn't clearly defined here. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. The steps in the process (customer development, pricing, etc.) could be considered events, but the examples didn't include such abstract events. Maybe the user doesn't want those. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn example 3, events like hostage exchange are considered, but in the given text, there's no specific event, just general processes. So maybe no event entities here. So focus on organization and person.\n\nSo entities:\n\n- LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Blogger, WordPress, Google as organizations.\n- 大野 (Dà Yě) as a person.\n\nFor relationships, 大野 is related to each of these organizations because he recommends them. Each relationship would have a description like \"大野 recommends using LinkedIn for customer development\" with a strength score. Since the recommendation is explicit in the text, maybe a strength of 5? The example with Vision Holdings and TechGlobal had a 5 for ownership. Here, it's a recommendation, so maybe 4 or 5.\n\nWait, in example 2, the relationship between TechGlobal and Vision Holdings was a 5 for ownership. In example 1, the chair relationship was 9. So maybe recommendations are lower. Let's say 4.\n\nAlso, the text mentions that these platforms are channels for customer development. So each platform is related to customer development. But customer development is a process, not an event. Since event is an allowed type, maybe \"customer development\" is an event? The text refers to it as a step in the process. But the examples didn't have such abstract events. Maybe it's better to stick to the entities provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"customer development\" is an event. But the user's examples didn't include such abstract terms. Let me check the examples again. In example 3, events were hostage exchange, which is a specific occurrence. The given text here is more about general steps, not specific events. So perhaps there are no event entities here. So only organizations and person.\n\nTherefore, the entities are the platforms (organizations) and 大野 (person). Relationships are between 大野 and each platform, as he recommends them. Also, the platforms might be related to each other as part of the same customer development strategies, but the text doesn't explicitly state that. So only the person-organization relationships.\n\nNow, formatting each entity and relationship as specified. The entity names should be capitalized. For example, \"LINKEDIN\", \"TWITTER\", etc. The entity descriptions should be comprehensive. For LinkedIn: \"A professional social networking site used for customer development in foreign trade.\" Similarly for others.\n\nFor 大野: \"Dà Yě is a person who provides advice on foreign trade practices, emphasizing the importance of customer development and the use of various online platforms.\"\n\nThen relationships: each platform is recommended by 大野. The relationship description would be \"Dà Yě recommends using [Platform] for customer development in foreign trade.\" Strength score 4.\n\nAre there any other relationships? The text mentions that using these platforms can help in starting a business. So maybe each platform is related to entrepreneurship, but that's not an entity here. So no.\n\nAlso, the text mentions \"公司\" (company) in general, but no specific company names except the platforms. So no other organizations.\n\nSo the final output should list all the platforms as organizations, 大野 as a person, and the relationships between them."}}], "created": 1745415083, "model": "deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1812, "prompt_tokens": 2498, "total_tokens": 4310, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1.

客户开发\n\n\n\n既然要做外贸生意，那就要有客户，这是开端，也是基础。\n\n\n\n有的公司会分客户给业务，这部分客户一定要好好维护，因为开发一个客户比维护一个客户成本高太多。在维护好了老客户的基础上，再去开发新客户。\n\n\n\n有的公司不分客户给业务，但有平台和展会。恕我直言，现在平台的询盘质量不太理想，花的时间不用太多。展会一年也就几次，好好把握住展会那几天，也是可以开发出高质量客户的。\n\n\n\n还有小伙伴抱怨，公司不参展，只有平台，平台和公司客户资源被老业务霸占着，没有新人的机会。这听着挺憋屈，但在大野看来可真是天赐良机，环境逼迫你去自己开辟出一条路，久而久之，你才是不被外贸淘汰的那个。\n\n\n\n这种情况下，你可以采取这些途径来开发：SNS站点（比如领英，推特，脸书），视频营销（比如油管），博客营销（如blogger,wordpress）,谷歌搜索等。渠道如此多，你只要精通其中一样，就够你玩的了。你只要玩好了，随时可以创业。\n\n\n\n这些渠道的学习资料和应用技巧大野会逐一跟大家分享，请持续关注。\n\n\n\n第一环节比较重要，笔墨多了点，客户开发方式见下图：\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2， 报价\n\n\n\n报价要注意3个问题：汇率，报价方式，付款方式\n\n\n\n汇率：要关注实时汇率，换算时留点空间，报价表里注明一句，汇率浮动如果超过2%，需重新报价。标明报价有效期。\n\n\n\n价格条款：FOB, CIF, CFR, EXW. 主要4种，FOB最常见。（不懂含义的百度，能百度的不问人）\n\n\n\n付款方式：最常见的是TT, LC, 按公司规定来。\n\n\n\n重点：报价一定要越详细越好，你跟客户之间也许只有一次邮件的机会。\n\n\n\n100份报价里，客户肯定挑一目了然的回复，因为沟通成本很高。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3， 谈价格\n\n\n\n有不讲价直接下单的客户，这种优质客户百里挑一，碰到了要珍惜。大野经常说一句话：不要利用客户的无知来赚取利益，不然你将陷入困境。所以不要太狠，适可而止，要做长久生意就得处处为客户着想。\n\n\n\n很多年前，大野碰到一个刚入行的大客户，不讲价，做一单赚20万，做了2单后没再做了。因为客户后来发现我暴利。这种信任的流失是不可逆的。\n\n\n\n讲价的客户呢，也相当优质，说明他有下单打算。但是把价格往死里压，整个市场比价格的客户，毫无忠诚度可言，毫不尊重咱们的劳动成果，坚决放弃掉！\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4， 签合同\n\n\n\n一般情况下，外贸合同比较简单，客户发PO，业务回PI过去，双方签章。\n\n\n\n跟有些大公司合作，会有一些合同附件条款，品牌授权书等。\n\n\n\n需要注意，这些都完成了也不算接了单，收到了订金才算。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5， 备料生产\n\n\n\n如果是工厂，就下生产通知。如果是外贸公司，就下采购单给供应商。这个环节一定要细心，货物规格颜色数量包装一定要按客户要求或者确认样品来做，特别是下采购单给上游供应商时，采购\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-r1",
